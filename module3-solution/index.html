[12 pp]

        The normal forms defined in relational database theory represent guidelines for record design. The guidelines corresponding to first through fifth normal forms are presented here, in terms that do not require an understanding of relational theory. The design guidelines are meaningful even if one is not using a relational database system. We present the guidelines without referring to the concepts of the relational model in order to emphasize their generality, and also to make them easier to understand. Our presentation conveys an intuitive sense of the intended constraints on record design, although in its informality it may be imprecise in some technical details. A comprehensive treatment of the subject is provided by Date [4].

        The normalization rules are designed to prevent update anomalies and data inconsistencies. With respect to performance tradeoffs, these guidelines are biased toward the assumption that all non-key fields will be updated frequently. They tend to penalize retrieval, since data which may have been retrievable from one record in an unnormalized design may have to be retrieved from several records in the normalized form. There is no obligation to fully normalize all records when actual performance requirements are taken into account.

        2 FIRST NORMAL FORM
        First normal form [1] deals with the "shape" of a record type.

        Under first normal form, all occurrences of a record type must contain the same number of fields.

        First normal form excludes variable repeating fields and groups. This is not so much a design guideline as a matter of definition. Relational database theory doesn't deal with records having a variable number of fields.

        3 SECOND AND THIRD NORMAL FORMS
        Second and third normal forms [2, 3, 7] deal with the relationship between non-key and key fields.

        Under second and third normal forms, a non-key field must provide a fact about the key, us the whole key, and nothing but the key. In addition, the record must satisfy first normal form.

      <p>
        We deal now only with "single-valued" facts. The fact could be a one-to-many relationship, such as the department of an employee, or a one-to-one relationship, such as the spouse of an employee. Thus the phrase "Y is a fact about X" signifies a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship between Y and X. In the general case, Y might consist of one or more fields, and so might X. In the following example, QUANTITY is a fact about the combination of PART and WAREHOUSE.

        3.1 Second Normal Form
        Second normal form is violated when a non-key field is a fact about a subset of a key. It is only relevant when the key is composite, i.e., consists of several fields. Consider the following inventory record:

        The key here consists of the PART and WAREHOUSE fields together, but WAREHOUSE-ADDRESS is a fact about the WAREHOUSE alone. The basic problems with this design are:

        The warehouse address is repeated in every record that refers to a part stored in that warehouse.
        If the address of the warehouse changes, every record referring to a part stored in that warehouse must be updated.
        Because of the redundancy, the data might become inconsistent, with different records showing different addresses for the same warehouse.
        If at some point in time there are no parts stored in the warehouse, there may be no record in which to keep the warehouse's address.
        To satisfy second normal form, the record shown above should be decomposed
        3.2 Third Normal Form
        Third normal form is violated when a non-key field is a fact about another non-key field, as in

        The EMPLOYEE field is the key. If each department is located in one place, then the LOCATION field is a fact about the DEPARTMENT -- in addition to being a fact about the EMPLOYEE. The problems with this design are the same as those caused by violations of second normal form:

        The department's location is repeated in the record of every employee assigned to that department.
        If the location of the department changes, every such record must be updated.
        Because of the redundancy, the data might become inconsistent, with different records showing different locations for the same department.
        If a department has no employees, there may be no record in which to keep the department's location.
        To satisfy third normal form, the record shown above should be decomposed into the two records:

        To summarize, a record is in second and third normal forms if every field is either part of the key or provides a (single-valued) fact about exactly the whole key and nothing else.

        3.3 Functional Dependencies
        In relational database theory, second and third normal forms are defined in terms of functional dependencies, which correspond approximately to our single-valued facts. A field Y is "functionally dependent" on a field (or fields) X if it is invalid to have two records with the same X-value but different Y-values. That is, a given X-value must always occur with the same Y-value. When X is a key, then all fields are by definition functionally dependent on X in a trivial way, since there can't be two records having the same X value.

      <p>
        There is a slight technical difference between functional dependencies and single-valued facts as we have presented them. Functional dependencies only exist when the things involved have unique and singular identifiers (representations). For example, suppose a person's address is a single-valued fact, i.e., a person has only one address. If we don't provide unique identifiers for people, then there will not be a functional dependency in the data:        Although each person has a unique address, a given name can appear with several different addresses. Hence we do not have a functional dependency corresponding to our single-valued fact.

        Similarly, the address has to be spelled identically in each occurrence in order to have a functional dependency. In the following case the same person appears to be living at two different addresses, again precluding a functional dependency.

        We are not defending the use of non-unique or non-singular representations. Such practices often lead to data maintenance problems of their own. We do wish to point out, however, that functional dependencies and the various normal forms are really only defined for situations in which there are unique and singular identifiers. Thus the design guidelines as we present them are a bit stronger than those implied by the formal definitions of the normal forms.

        For instance, we as designers know that in the following example there is a single-valued fact about a non-key field, and hence the design is susceptible to all the update anomalies mentioned earlier.

        However, in formal terms, there is no functional dependency here between FATHER'S-ADDRESS and FATHER, and hence no violation of third normal form.

        4 FOURTH AND FIFTH NORMAL FORMS
        Fourth [5] and fifth [6] normal forms deal with multi-valued facts. The multi-valued fact may correspond to a many-to-many relationship, as with employees and skills, or to a many-to-one relationship, as with the children of an employee (assuming only one parent is an employee). By "many-to-many" we mean that an employee may have several skills, and a skill may belong to several employees.


        Instead, they should be represented in the two records

        Note that other fields, not involving multi-valued facts, are permitted to occur in the record, as in the case of the QUANTITY field in the earlier PART/WAREHOUSE example.

        The main problem with violating fourth normal form is that it leads to uncertainties in the maintenance policies. Several policies are possible for maintaining two independent multi-valued facts in one record:

        (1) A disjoint format, in which a record contains either a skill or a
        Other problems caused by violating fourth normal form are similar in spirit to those mentioned earlier for violations of second or third normal form. They take different variations depending on the chosen maintenance policy:

        If there are repetitions, then updates have to be done in multiple records, and they could become inconsistent.
        Insertion of a new skill may involve looking for a record with a blank skill, or inserting a new record with a possibly blank language, or inserting multiple records pairing the new skill with some or all of the
